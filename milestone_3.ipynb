    "The idea of the original paper is to demonstarte (if possible) that there is a racial profiling trend across the united states, the authors do so by using severall methods that mostly take data across all available states. We have decided here to limit the search to one state, as we think that there may be different trends in the different states (As demonstrated for instance by the marijuane legalisation/search rate test). We also decided to implement a method that the paper hasn't used: The decision tree, which we think is a robust statistical test that correspond to the data we have. We know that our conclusions won't be able to caracterize the polices officers behaviour across the states but only to the specifical instance of the washington state patrol. "

Sevrall million of stops are categorized there but as we said we decided to limit ourselves to only one state, which we thought needed to be heavily populated and where state patrols had recorded  a lot of stops owith information on the racial appearence of the subjects, the time of the stop, the subject age, the subjet sex and if a search had been conducted. Our choice was therefore the state of washington and the 11 million state patrol stopps.\n",
