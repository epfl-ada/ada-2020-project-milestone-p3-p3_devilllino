2. Abstract:

The idea of the original paper is to demonstrate (if possible) that there is a racial profiling trend across the united states, the authors do so by using severall methods that mostly take data across all available states. We would like to limit the search to one state, as we think that there may be different trends in the different states (As demonstrated for instance by the marijuana legalisation/search rate test). We also want to implement a method that the paper hasn't used: The decision tree, which we think is a robust statistical test that correspond to the data we have and that will enable us to acces the statistical importance of each of the variable a police officer may take in account. We know that our conclusions won't be able to caracterize the polices officers behaviour across the states but only to the specifical instance of the washington state patrol, but that is the aim. 

3.	Research Questions:

We want to find out which variables affect the outcome (search or no search) the most. THe variables that we are interested in are persieved race, age, sex, state of the legalization and the years since or to the change in legalization.

4.	Proposed dataset:

The original paper gives a link to the source of their data the Stanford Open Policing project :https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/. Severall million of stops are categorized there but as we said we decided to limit ourselves to only one state, which we thought needed to be heavily populated and where state patrols had recorded  a lot of stops with information on the racial appearence of the subjects, the time of the stop, the subject age, the subjet sex and if a search had been conducted. Our choice was therefore the state of washington and the 11 million state patrol stopps.

But this also meant that the file containing all these stops was really large and the computation time being so long we had to take only parts of the original csv.  To achieve this, as the data is sorted by date, we sampled the orignal dataset randomly and took a about 500 000. That is aproximately 4,5% .
