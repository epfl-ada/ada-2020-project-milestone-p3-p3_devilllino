# **Ada Project : Creative extension**
## Milestone P3

### **Supplementary method :** Decision tree

2. Abstract:

The idea of the original paper is to demonstrate (if possible) that there is a racial profiling trend across the united states, the authors do so by using severall methods that mostly take data across all available states. We have decided here to limit the search to one state, as we think that there may be different trends in the different states (As demonstrated for instance by the marijuana legalisation/search rate test). We also decided to implement a method that the paper hasn't used: The decision tree, which we think is a robust statistical test that correspond to the data we have. We know that our conclusions won't be able to caracterize the polices officers behaviour across the states but only to the specifical instance of the washington state patrol.
